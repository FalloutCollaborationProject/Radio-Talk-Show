Vault Girl: Hey there, vault dwellers and surface scavvers! This is Vault Girl with a special announcement for all you holotape hunters and strategy fans. Ever stumble across a battered RimWorld holotape out in the wastes? Maybe you paid a whole sack of caps for one at a trading post? Well, listen up!

Introducing the Collaboration Project series of mods; your ticket to bringing the biggest universes right into your RimWorld colony! Ever wanted to see Elder Scrolls mages, or even Lord of the Rings orcs braving a toxic thunderstorm together? How about Stargate expeditions, Star Wars blaster battles, Dune spice wars, or Dragon Age adventures; all in one place?

With the Collaboration Project mods, you can turn your RimWorld into a wild mashup of your favorite worlds. Build, survive, and tell stories you never thought possible. So next time you find a RimWorld holotape, pop it in and mod it up. Because in the wastes, imagination is the best currency.

This is Vault Girl, reminding you: keep your mods updated, your colonists happy, and your eyes peeled for the next big adventure!
