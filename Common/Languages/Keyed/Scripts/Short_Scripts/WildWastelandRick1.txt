[Radio static, song fades out]

Vault Girl: Good morning, Vault dwellers and surface survivors! This is Vault Girl, coming to you live from somewhere safe, sound, and only slightly radioactive. Today on “Wild Wasteland Wonders,” we’re joined by a real legend—straight from the sunbaked sands of California, it’s Ranger Rick of the Desert Rangers! Welcome, Rick!

Ranger Rick: Thanks, Vault Girl. Always a pleasure to be somewhere the coffee isn’t made from Brahmin droppings.

Vault Girl: We do our best! So, Rick, rumor has it you once talked your way out of a Deathclaw nest with nothing but a smolder and a half-eaten Fancy Lad Snack Cake. True?

Ranger Rick: Well, I wouldn’t say “talked” so much as “distracted while running.” Turns out Deathclaws love snack cakes. Who knew?

Vault Girl: The more you know! Now, you’ve wandered from the Mojave all the way to the Capital Wasteland. Seen anything… uniquely wild lately?

Ranger Rick: Oh, plenty. Just last week, I helped a settlement in New Reno fend off a pack of rad-roaches the size of molerats. Turns out, they were after a stash of pre-war hair gel. Shiniest roaches I ever did see.

Vault Girl: Fashionable and ferocious! And I hear you’ve got a knack for getting in and out of trouble, is that true?

Ranger Rick: Let’s just say, if there’s a wrong turn to take, I’ll find it. But hey, it’s not an adventure unless you accidentally set off a car alarm in a Super Mutant camp.

Vault Girl: Words to live by! Any advice for our listeners braving the wastes?

Ranger Rick: Keep your revolver clean, your friends close, and never trust a smiling Mister Handy with a paintbrush.

Vault Girl: Wise words from a true Ranger. Thanks for joining us, Rick! Stay safe out there—and remember, folks, if you see a man in a duster with a winning grin followed by a trail of chaos, say hi to him for me.

Vault Girl: This is Vault Girl, signing off—may your water be pure and your adventures wild!
