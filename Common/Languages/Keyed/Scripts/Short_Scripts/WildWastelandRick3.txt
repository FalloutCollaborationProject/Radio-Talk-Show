[Radio static, song fades out]

Vault Girl: Welcome back, survivors and synths alike! It’s Vault Girl, your guide to the weird and wonderful. Today, Ranger Rick is here with another tale from the wilds. What’s the latest, Rick?

Ranger Rick: Hold up there a sec Vault Girl, I’ll tell you what’s not wonderful....synths. Out in the Commonwealth, you can’t walk ten feet without bumping into one of those tin-can imposters. I don’t care how much they look or act like us, they’re not people. Never will be.

Vault Girl: Some pretty strong words there, Rick! Did something happen to you out there?

Ranger Rick: I had ran into a settler camp being harassed by a synth, pretending to be someone’s long lost brother. Folks were ready to risk everything for it. But me? I say you can’t replace a real person with wires and circuits. Not worth saving, not in the slightest.

Vault Girl: That’s a tough stance. Some folks say synths deserve a chance; what do you say to them?

Ranger Rick: Well I say, let a toaster be a toaster. The wasteland’s hard enough without having to wonder if your neighbor’s got a motherboard for a heart.

Vault Girl: Well, listeners, you heard it from Ranger Rick; opinions in the wasteland are as wild as the creatures! Whether you’re flesh, chrome, or somewhere in between, stay safe out there.

Vault Girl: This is Vault Girl, reminding you: keep your Geiger counter handy, and your mind open—just in case.
