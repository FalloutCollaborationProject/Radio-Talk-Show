[Radio static, song fades out]

Vault Girl: Hello again, all you vault dwellers, scavvers, and super mutants with a taste for culture! It’s Vault Girl, back with “Wild Wasteland Wonders.” Today, Ranger Rick returns with another tale from the radioactive road. Welcome back, Rick!

Ranger Rick: Thanks, Vault Girl. Glad to be here and not being chased by giant ants for once.

Vault Girl: Speaking of, I heard you had a run-in with some unusual wildlife out near The Pitt. Care to share?

Ranger Rick: Oh, you mean the time I stumbled into a herd of Brahmin… square dancing? I thought the heat was getting to me, but nope—turns out, some old-world radio was still playing in a collapsed barn, and those Brahmin had rhythm.

Vault Girl: Only in the wasteland! Did you join in?

Ranger Rick: I tried, but I only got two left feet. The Brahmin were better dancers than most the folks I know.

Vault Girl: That’s a sight I’d pay caps to see! Any other oddities on your travels?

Ranger Rick: Well, there was the time I traded a can of Cram for directions from a talking Mr. Gutsy. He insisted I salute every mailbox I passed. Still not sure if it was a prank or just old programming.

Vault Girl: The mail must go through! Any advice for listeners who find themselves in a square-dancing stampede?

Ranger Rick: Keep your wits sharp, your boots laced, and if you hear music in the ruins—maybe sit that one out.

Vault Girl: Wise as ever, Rick. Thanks for sharing another wild wasteland wonder! This is Vault Girl, reminding you: keep your Geiger counter handy, and your sense of humor closer.

Vault Girl: Until next time, stay safe and stay curious!
