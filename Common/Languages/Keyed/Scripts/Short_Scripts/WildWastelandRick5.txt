[Radio static, song fades out]

Vault Girl: Hey there, all you wanderers and weirdos! It’s Vault Girl, coming at you with another episode of “Wild Wasteland Wonders.” I’ve got Ranger Rick here, and rumor has it he’s got a story that’ll make your Pip-Boy spin. What happened this time, Rick?

Ranger Rick: Well, I was trekking through the outskirts of New Reno when I stumbled on a group of ghouls… having a tea party. Pink hats, porcelain cups, the whole nine yards.

Vault Girl: Ghouls with manners? That’s a first! Did you join in?

Ranger Rick: I tried, but they insisted I wear a feather boa. Turns out, it was a “fancy dress” party. One of them poured me a cup of what they called “Radberry Brew.” I’m still not sure if it was tea or just mildly radioactive water.

Vault Girl: Only in the wasteland! Did you make it out with all your fingers?

Ranger Rick: All ten, but I think I left with a new appreciation for ghoul etiquette—and a slight glow.

Vault Girl: Any advice for listeners who get invited to a ghoul tea party?

Ranger Rick: Always compliment the host, and never ask what’s in the tea.

Vault Girl: Wise words! This is Vault Girl, reminding you: out here, expect the unexpected—and don’t forget your feather boa.
