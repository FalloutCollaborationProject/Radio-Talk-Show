[Radio static, song fades in]

Vault Girl: Evening, wanderers. This is Vault Girl, tuning in as the sun sets over the Mojave. Out here, the wilds aren’t just strange. They’re dangerous. Tonight, I’m joined by Ranger Rick, who’s seen the worst of it on Nevada’s frontlines. Rick, what’s on your mind?

Ranger Rick: Thanks, Vault Girl. Some nights, it’s hard to forget. Nevada’s not just sand and old world ghosts It’s where we bled to keep the Legion back.

Vault Girl: You were there when the fighting was at its worst, right?

Ranger Rick: Yeah. Near Searchlight, we were outnumbered, just a handful of Rangers. The Legion came at us in waves, chanting, never stopping. I remember the smell of burning trucks, the sound of bullets and screams. Dutch went down early. Ramirez kept firing even after he was hit. I dragged him out, but by that time he had already lost an arm. I still see their faces when I close my eyes.

Vault Girl: That’s heavy, Rick. What kept you going?

Ranger Rick: Each other. The hope that maybe, just maybe, we’d hold the line long enough for someone else to see another sunrise. But the Legion… they don’t care about hope. They just keep coming.

Vault Girl: For everyone listening out there always remember, the Mojave’s full of scars, but also survivors. Thanks for sharing, Rick.
[song swells]

Vault Girl: This is Vault Girl, signing off for the night. Stay strong, and remember: even in the darkest desert, you’re not alone.
